# Blog

This repository consists of my blog, the code is made with 2 parts: The front-end & back-end, admin & user parts.

The user when he visits the main page, a request is made to the databse that is full with blogposts and when he chooses to read a post he clicks on it and reads the full post, only the blog admin has the right to add a new post which requires him to authenticate in a seperate link where he can add new posts.
